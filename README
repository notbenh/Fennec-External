    Fennec::External - Test non-perl code with Fennec

CURRENT LANGUAGES
    C   C is supported, See Fennec::External::C and Fennec::External::C::Raw

PLANNED SUPPORT
    Perl6
        Perl6 support is planned soon.

ADDING SUPPORT FOR A LANGUAGE
        package Fennec::External::MyLang;
        use strict;
        use warnings;
        use Fennec::External 'KEYWORD';

        sub execute {
            my $self = shift;
            my ( $fennec_test_obj ) = @_;
            my $external_code = $self->code;

            my ($pass, $tap) = process_code( $external_code );
            $self->merge_tap( $tap )
            return $pass;
        }

        sub process_code { ... }

    Override the execute() method, it should process your code then return
    true/false for pass or fail. If your external code produces TAP output
    you should capture it and pass it to $self->merge_tap( $tap ).
